As all of us will have a vacation tomorrow, I would like to send my most sincere thanks and best wishes to everyone, Maik, Morte, Nicolas, and Shubham! Thank you all for taking care of me.

It was a pleasure to join you and work with you! I have really enjoyed this month and week. I have gained a lot during this time, like knowing how the team and workflow work, joining the PPP project, and finishing my first script.

To Maik, thank you so much for taking care of me from the first day of my internship, helping me set my internship goals together, hanging out in Düsseldorf, etc., and especially for your interest in my situation whenever you were in the studio. And I would like to apologize to you for working overtime, for working in Sweden, and for not going to the Christmas supermarket together this time because of my illness.

To Morte, I still appreciate all your help and daily communication, especially since I often ask some fundamental questions. You are always patient in answering them for me. I hope I can help you more in the next year.

To Nicolas, I miss the time together in Düsseldorf! I'm happy to have the opportunity to meet face to face, and thank you for your help! I hope there will be more opportunities to hang out together afterward. Next time I can teach you more Chinese, and I'll learn some French too!

To Shubham, even though we didn't meet face to face, we will soon! Thanks likewise for your interest and for giving me feedback on my work so far! Looking forward to what we can do next year, as well as going to taste some of your nation's restaurants!
